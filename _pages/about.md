### About the Workshop

Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) has attracted growing research interest in recent years, particularly since the emergence of conversational agents based on generative AI methods. generally focus on complex interactive processes between searchers and CIR systems, with little interest in modelling the user within this process. The goal of this work is to provide a forum for the exploration of user modelling and its evaluation with CIR. In this workshop, we aim to collect views and proposals for user modelling with CIR, especially relating to algorithm system design, personalization, and how it might be simulated and evaluated.

The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for discussion on the user-centric approaches to conversational information retrieval. The main theme of the workshop is user modelling. The workshop will explore different areas relating to user modelling ranging from personalization, conversation modelling, user simulations and evaluation of CIR systems.

The workshop would be a half-day workshop with keynotes focusing on either in-depth analysis or broad-ranging approaches to conversational information retrieval. It will include an invited keynote speaker and presentations of the accepted papers. We will create break-out discussion groups based on the main research topics/themes that emerge from among the contributions. Following this we will have a discussion panel discussing the presented contributions from an integrated perspective. The results of the workshop will be published at the SIGIR Forum.
