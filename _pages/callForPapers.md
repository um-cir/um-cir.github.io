We invite researchers in machine learning and statistics to submit their latest work to the NeurIPS 2022 workshop on score-based methods.


# Key dates

* Submission deadline: **Sept 26, 2022 (11:59 pm AOE)**
* Acceptance notification: **Oct 20, 2022**
* Camera ready for accepted submissions: **Nov 25, 2022**
* 

# topics

We encourage submissions that relate (but not limited) to the following topics:

* Foundations and methodologies of score-based methods
  * generative modeling (score-based generative models, diffusion models, etc.)
  * differential equations
  * probabilistic inference, e.g. MCMC, variational inference
  * optimal transport
  * gradient estimation, control variates
  * Stein's method

* Applications of score-based methods
  * generation of images, video, audio, molecules, etc
  * scientific & engineering applications
  * solving inverse problems, e.g. denoising, super-resolution, etc.
  * dynamical systems
  * hypothesis testing
  * causal discovery & inference



# submission details

We invite researchers to submit their recent work on the development, analysis, or application of score-based methods. A submission should take the form of a short paper of **4 pages in PDF** format using the **[template](/assets/templates/SBM_template.zip)**. Additional pages containing references and appendices are allowed. For questions and troubleshooting of the template, visit CTAN.

The review process will be double-blind. Author names need to be anonymized and references/appendices may extend as far as needed beyond the **4-page upper limit**. Submissions may include a supplement/appendix, but reviewers are not responsible for reading any supplementary material.

All accepted submissions will be accompanied by a poster presentation. A number of selected papers will also be invited for a contributed oral presentation.

**Dual submission policy**: If a paper has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference (including the NeurIPS 2022 conference), it should be extended in order to be accepted at our workshop. If a paper is currently under review (e.g. in AISTATS 2023 or ICLR 2023), it can still be submitted to this workshop.

The submission website is on **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Workshop/SBM)**. Camera-ready versions are due by **Nov 25, 2022**, and will be posted on the workshop website.
