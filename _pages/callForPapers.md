We invite researchers in machine learning and statistics to submit their latest work to the NeurIPS 2022 workshop on score-based methods.


## Key dates

* Submission website open: **September 01, 2024**
* Submission deadline: **September 15, 2024 (11:59 pm AOE)**
* Acceptance notification: **September 30, 2024**
* Workshop Date: **December 12, 2024**
* 

## Themes and Topics

We encourage submissions that relate (but not limited) to the following themes and topics:

* Personalization
  * New methods for modelling users in CIR (personalization)
  * Modelling user emotion
  * Mining and modelling users
  * User knowledge representation and extraction
  * Datasets: new source, new way to collect
  * Introducing personalization
  * Focusing on specialized user groups and personality, for example psychologically affected users

* Modelling Conversation
  * Alignment between current user modelling and the real user in CIR
  * Modelling user and userâ€™s behaviour
  * Conversational Knowledge extraction and representation
  * Other theoretical models and foundations of user-centric modelling of CIR.

* User Simulation
  * User simulation of CIR
  * Dataset for user simulation of CIR
  * Other theoretical models and foundations of user simulation of CIR.


* Evaluation
  * User-centered evaluation of CIR
  * User studies, user engagement
  * System-oriented evaluation of CIR
  * Simulated Evaluation of CIR
  * Metrics to measure the effectiveness of CIR
  * Data sets, Test collection, Resources
  * Other theoretical models and foundations of user-centric evaluation of CIR.


## Submission Details

We invite researchers to submit their recent work on the development, analysis, or application of score-based methods. A submission should take the form of a short paper of **4 pages in PDF** format using the **[template](/assets/templates/SBM_template.zip)**. Additional pages containing references and appendices are allowed.

The review process will be double-blind. Author names need to be anonymized and references/appendices may extend as far as needed beyond the **4-page upper limit**. Submissions may include a supplement/appendix, but reviewers are not responsible for reading any supplementary material.

All accepted submissions will be accompanied by a poster presentation. A number of selected papers will also be invited for a contributed oral presentation.

**Dual submission policy**: If a paper has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference (including the NeurIPS 2022 conference), it should be extended in order to be accepted at our workshop. If a paper is currently under review (e.g. in AISTATS 2023 or ICLR 2023), it can still be submitted to this workshop.

The submission website is on **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Workshop/SBM)**. Camera-ready versions are due by **Nov 25, 2022**, and will be posted on the workshop website.
