We invite researchers in machine learning and statistics to submit their latest work to the UM-CIR 2024 workshop on user modelling aspects in conversational information retrieval.


## Key dates

* Submission website open: **September 01, 2024**
* Submission deadline: **October 3, 2024**
* Acceptance notification: **October 18, 2024**
* Workshop Date: **December 12, 2024**
  
Note: All submission deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE Time Zone (Anywhere on Earth).

## Themes and Topics

We encourage submissions that relate (but not limited) to the following themes and topics:

* **Personalization**
  * New methods for modelling users in CIR (personalization)
  * Modelling user emotion
  * Mining and modelling users
  * User knowledge representation and extraction
  * Datasets: new source, new way to collect
  * Introducing personalization
  * Focusing on specialized user groups and personality, for example psychologically affected users

* **Modelling Conversation**
  * Alignment between current user modelling and the real user in CIR
  * Modelling user and userâ€™s behaviour
  * Conversational Knowledge extraction and representation
  * Other theoretical models and foundations of user-centric modelling of CIR.

* **User Simulation**
  * User simulation of CIR
  * Dataset for user simulation of CIR
  * Other theoretical models and foundations of user simulation of CIR.


* **Evaluation**
  * User-centered evaluation of CIR
  * User studies, user engagement
  * System-oriented evaluation of CIR
  * Simulated Evaluation of CIR
  * Metrics to measure the effectiveness of CIR
  * Data sets, Test collection, Resources
  * Other theoretical models and foundations of user-centric evaluation of CIR.


## Submission Details

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered for publication in any other forum. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically in PDF format following the workshop instructions (TBA). 

Submissions of papers must be at least 2 pages and at most 9 pages (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, and any content except references) in length, with unlimited pages for references. Submissions of papers must be in English, in PDF format, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official) templates are available from the [ACM Website](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) (use the "sigconf" proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word).

All submissions of papers must be original and have not been published or accepted elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.The review process of the submitted manuscripts will be done together with our programme committee. The selection will depend on the technical soundness and relevance of submissions to the community that the workshop is targeting.

<!-- We invite researchers to submit their recent work on the development, analysis, or application of score-based methods. A submission should take the form of a short paper of **4 pages in PDF** format using the **[template](/assets/templates/SBM_template.zip)**. Additional pages containing references and appendices are allowed. -->

The review process will be double-blind. Author names need to be anonymized.
<!-- Submissions may include a supplement/appendix, but reviewers are not responsible for reading any supplementary material. -->

<!-- 
The submission website is on **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Workshop/SBM)**. Camera-ready versions are due by **Nov 25, 2022**, and will be posted on the workshop website. -->
